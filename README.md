Orbion: AI-powered space debris collision prediction and satellite risk monitoring

# Orbion

**Orbion** is an AI-powered space tech prototype that predicts the risk of **satellite collisions with space debris**. It provides a real-time dashboard for monitoring satellite health and orbital threats using deep learning models.

---

## **Features**
- Predicts collision probability between satellites and nearby debris.
- Displays real-time satellite metrics: Temperature, Battery Level, Thruster Activity, Radiation Exposure, Orbit Stability.
- Alerts users when the predicted collision risk exceeds a safe threshold.
- Historical data visualization with charts and tables.
- Fully functional **full-stack prototype** with:
  - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - Backend: Flask API
  - Database: SQLite
  - AI Model: Deep Learning (PyTorch)
